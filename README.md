# BrickBreakerGame
This is my project.Itâ€™s a GUI-based project used with the swing library to organize all the elements that work under the Brick Breaker Game.
In this classic Brick Breaker Game, the goal is to eliminate all the bricks in each level by bouncing your ball off them.
I used an array to keep track of how many times each brick has been hit, as well as to determine when there are no more bricks left on the board.
Data Structure: 2D arrays.
Tech and Tools: Java Swing, Java AWT, OOPs concepts,JDK and NeatBeans IDE.
